Paragraph describing the problem we are solving: Many people struggle to track where their money goes each month, leading to overspending and savings shortfalls. Manual expense tracking is time-consuming, and most apps only show past transactions without helping prevent future mistakes. Users often forget about recurring subscriptions or small purchases that add up over time. Without real-time alerts or smart categorization, it's easy to exceed budgets accidentally. Our app solves this by automatically sorting expenses, flagging unusual spending, and setting up simple "round-up" savings rules to build financial habits effortlessly.
