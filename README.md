Paragraph describing the problem we are solving: Many people struggle to track where their money goes each month, leading to overspending and savings shortfalls. Manual expense tracking is time-consuming, and most apps only show past transactions without helping prevent future mistakes. Users often forget about recurring subscriptions or small purchases that add up over time. Without real-time alerts or smart categorization, it's easy to exceed budgets accidentally. Our app solves this by automatically sorting expenses, flagging unusual spending, and setting up simple "round-up" savings rules to build financial habits effortlessly.

Docker usage: We have utilized Docker in a step of our Group Budgeting Project to build images and display up to date, real-time packaged software through all these images and containers.

Javadoc usage: We have used Javadocs to display an accurate roadmap of the code that's been used in the duration of the project in order for it to be understandable to the general audience. 

Github Actions usage: During the project, we used Github Actions to automate the workflow along with Docker to push and commit code.
